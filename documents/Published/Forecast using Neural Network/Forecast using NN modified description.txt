Brief description:
Uses neural network algorithm to forecast future values based on historical data.

Long description:
Forecast the future values based on the historical data by employing Neural Network algorithm for time series forecasting. Forecasting is useful for a variety of professions spread over numerous fields, be it budget, sales, demand or inventory. Better forecasts of future lead to better and more well-informed decisions. Forecasting using Neural Network implements an ‘Artificial Neural Network’ to learn from observed data over a time to predict the values of future. 
It employs a single layer feed forward network with lagged inputs to deal with time series values. 

Key features include:
•	Ability to use years or distinct numerical values in place of Date/Date&Time field. (The visual will work for both numerical series i.e. years/numbers and proper Date/Time values)
•	Ability of hover tooltips and highlighting a portion of the plot
•	Capability to manually adjust the parameters of the learning model

R package dependencies (auto installed): Forecast, plotly, zoo, xts
