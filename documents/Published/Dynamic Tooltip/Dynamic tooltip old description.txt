Brief description:
Increase your audience’s understanding of your data by adding data to your visuals.

Long description:
Most tooltips display static information or images. With this visual, you can display data fetched from a data source. This function allows you the freedom to create a tooltip that does not require constant adjustment. When your data changes, the tooltip changes too. It’s as easy as that.
This works well with static statements. If you would just like to add some helpful information for your audience, simply enter your text into the display field.
The decimal points, type of display units, and the tooltip’s icon image are all customizable.
